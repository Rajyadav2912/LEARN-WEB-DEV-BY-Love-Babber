                "Hello, my name is Raj yadav. I have always been passionate about the Software industry. Currently, I am
                learning Java
                with DSA and Web Development. In terms of my education, I am a 3rd-year B.Tech student specializing in
                Electronics and
                communication engineering. I have gained valuable experience and skills through my minor project.
                When it comes to my personality, I am a very curious person when I am working.
                I am excited to be a part of this conversation and look forward to sharing and learning from each

            <li><b>Role: </b>Programmer, Designer, Leader</li>
            <li>Developed Street Light Monitoring System using IoT Technology. The system uses sensors to detect light
                levels and
                automatically adjusts the brightness of street lights accordingly. Additionally, the system provides
                real-time
                monitoring
                and status updates on the Blynk application for individual street lights, allowing for maintenance,
                Improved energy
                efficiency and cost savings were achieved through the use of this system</li>

            <li><b> Key Skills: </b> Microcontroller, Embedded Systems, Sensors
            </li>
            <li>This IoT workshop was where participants learn about the fundamentals of IoT technology and its
                applications. The
                workshop covered topics such as sensor networks, and cloud servers. Participants were given hands-on
                experience with
                Arduino programming microcontrollers and building IoT systems using various sensors and devices. The
                workshop
                provided practical knowledge and skills to enable participants to design and implement their own IoT
                projects</li>
